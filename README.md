# Weather App

Technigo JS/React Course project THREE: Project Weather App, by F. Cassisa & C. Ã–berg. 
This app shows the weather of the day plus a forecast of the next five days. If the user wants, it can show some extra data. The same small application asks, after loading, the geolocation in order to give a forecast of the nearby city. 

If not, there's a search bar on top where the user can input a city and look for its weather.

## The problem
We started laying out the main HTML, CSS & Javascript together, following the steps in the instructions. Then, during the week we branched out to get some extra implementations going. We added Geolocation, a Better Search bar, some Extra data and we worked some time to get the style we wanted. 

Generally speaking it's resembling good the Design2, which was the one chosen. On top of that it has been added some animations. 

We tried to work with branch, pull requests and resolve conflicts we faced on the go. Some of them were easy, some others took some time to get fixed. Generally speaking the whole process went quite good. We faced a major problem in merging when we did some refactoring due to some functionalities that required a code written in a different way. In that case, the merge was long since it had many conflicts to be resolved.
